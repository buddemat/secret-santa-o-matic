# secret-santa-o-matic

Perl/Tk script to automatically determine a random sequence of Secret Santas for a list of people. 

`./secret-santa-o-matic.pl`

- includes the possibility to set invalid (i.e. forbidden) combinations. 
- generates .txt-files as output that can be sent to the individual people so that nobody knows who is Secret Santa for whom.
- will terminate after 20 tries if no valid sequence can be found.
